IMPORTANT : I have never and never will authorise people to copy my code or fork my files onto their repositories. This is plagiarism and I would have no hand in it.This is in the light of me discovering that a few people may have and indeed have forked my files without any prior permission which is utterly unacceptable. Therefore I implore the professors, who all are checking the gits of the students to go through everyone's activity history. Any such unscrupulous activities in the future will definitely result in me reporting the perpetrators personally to the concerned faculty if it comes to my notice, capisce? You have been warned.

My work and any resulting bugs, mistakes are mine, and is the result of me putting my time into learning more and perfecting my code over hours. Representing it as yours would a be a ground for persecution under the official rules of NISER, Bhubaneswar.

Be honest, learn more, code and practice more. That is the way to go and trust me, it would be one heck of a ride. * enter Mr. Robot feels *

Happy (honest and original) coding y'all
